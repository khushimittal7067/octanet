        <p class="secsecond text-small">The days of students having to spend hours looking for specific information on books are gone. The Internet has changed everything about our society, including the way we learn. Kids that were born after the Internet, grew up having instant access to information. And they expect the same dynamics when they learn at schools.The education industry had to adapt, and part of this process was including artificial intelligence in their operations. Artificial intelligence is one of our greatest achievements so far. It is the technology trying to emulate human intelligence. Although we haven’t reached a point where we can completely simulate a human mind, we can simulate some aspects of it like learning and recognizing objects or words.</p>
